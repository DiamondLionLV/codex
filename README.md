# Innovators Team discord chatbot

## About
We created Kai to help people with mental health issues and help to comfor them. They can talk to Kai about basically anything. They can talk to him about their problems, just talk about life and basically have a chat like with a real human. We chose to name this bot Kai because it means "Forgiveness" which is excatly what we need in order to start fresh.
