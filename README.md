## How to setup this bot

If you want to try out our bot you need to create ".env" file by this example and replace [DC_TOKEN](https://discord.com/developers/applications/) with your bots token and [OPENAI_API_KEY](https://openai.com/api/) with your openAI API Key.

```
DC_TOKEN="DiscordBotToken"

```

Next you need to run `npm install` in your terminal. That's all now you can run this bot using `node .` in terminal.

You can chat with it, ask whatever you want. Also we created `!help` command to display suicide hotline numbers in Baltic states so you can also check that out.
